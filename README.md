# python-api-challenge

What's the weather like as we approach the equator?

These scripts require API keys for open weather map and Google Places .
Please provide the keys as below in api_keys.py file - 

		# OpenWeatherMap API Key
		weather_api_key = "Your Key Here!"

		# Google API Key
		g_key = "Your Key Here!"


Python script was used to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world.

A series of scatter plots are built to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

The weather data was then used to plan future vacations by using Google Places API.
Plotted the hotels on top of a humidity heatmap.
